To be able to receive player events, call the `registerEventListener` method of the `EvoWSPlayer` or `EvoWrtcPlayer` and pass on to it a handler that accepts two parameters.  The first parameter will be the `eventName`, and the second parameter, the `eventData`.  Please note that not all events will include an `eventData`.

**Example:**

```
var player = new EvoWsPlayer ( options ) ;
player.registerEventListener ( function (event,description){
                    if ( event == 'transportclosed' ) {
                        // do something...etc.
                    }
                });
```
