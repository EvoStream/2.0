This document describes how to install and configure EvoStream Media Server software on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), an Amazon web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

Amazon EC2 is a cloud-computing platform that virtualizes computing resources as virtual machines. A single virtual machine configuration is registered as an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

EvoStream provides an Amazon Linux  AMI with a preconfigured version of EvoStream Media Server that is ready to start using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Management Console. You can use this AMI to launch EMS for EC2 instances, paying for your running instance time and bandwidth consumption only while the instances are running. You can launch EMS instances in specific geographical locations that are closer to your audience to reduce latency and in multiple geographical locations to provide high levels of redundancy.
