The new web UI ensures a better handling of the stream in your Evostream Media Server. With the all new and intuitive design, users can find every setting much more easily and see whatâ€™s happening on their streams. Monitoring and controlling stream status has never been easier. 

To meet different feature requirements of the EMS, the web UI is separated into 3 different parts: Dashboard, Streams and API Explorer.

This guide provides instructions on how to use the Web-based User Interface for the EvoStream Media Server. It will cover the basics using the Web-based User Interface. 

After [starting the Evostream Media Server](http://docs.evostream.com/2.0/userguide_startems.html), you can open the Web-based User Interface on a browser by going to the 
the following URL:  **http://[EMS IP ADDRESS]:4100/**
